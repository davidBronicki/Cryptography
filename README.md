# Cryptography
Cryptography algorithms for class

This is a simple program to explore various cryptographic
techniques. The available ciphers are:
- affine: Linear cipher in modular number system.
- columnar: Transposition cipher.
- RSA: The one. The only. Standard public key encryption
with wide reaching applications.
- RSA with large numbers: Uses custom big numbers class for arithmetic.
